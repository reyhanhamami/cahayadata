            <h3>2. Content Marketing</h3>
            <p>Content marketing focuses on creating and distributing valuable, relevant content to attract and engage a target audience.

            <h3>3. Social Media Marketing</h3>
            <p>Social media marketing uses platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn to promote products or services. It involves creating and sharing content, engaging with followers, and running paid advertising campaigns.</p>
            <h3>4. Pay-Per-Click (PPC) Advertising</h3>
            <p>PPC is an online advertising model where advertisers pay a fee each time their ad is clicked. Google Ads is a popular PPC platform, allowing businesses to bid for ad placement in search engine results and other websites.</p>
            <h3>5. Email Marketing</h3>
            <p>Email marketing involves sending targeted emails to a list of subscribers. It is used to nurture leads, build customer relationships, and drive sales through personalized messages and offers.</p>
            <h3>6. Affiliate Marketing</h3>
            <p>Affiliate marketing is a performance-based strategy where businesses reward affiliates (partners) for bringing in customers through their marketing efforts. This can involve bloggers, influencers, or other companies.</p>
            <h3>7. Influencer Marketing</h3>
            <p>Influencer marketing leverages individuals with a large social media following to promote products or services. Influencers can provide authentic endorsements that resonate with their audience.</p>
